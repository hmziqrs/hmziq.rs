# Star Field Restoration

## Issue
The newly created `StarFieldOptimized.tsx` had several rendering issues:
- Stars were not visible
- Shader compilation issues
- Incorrect buffer attribute setup
- Performance problems

## Solution
Restored the original `OptimizedStarField.tsx` from commit `2e62988` which was previously tested and working well.

## Features of Restored Star Field
1. **3-tier LOD System**
   - Near stars: Full quality with sparkle effects
   - Medium stars: Twinkle effects only
   - Far stars: Simple rendering

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Pre-calculated sin lookup table
   - CPU-based twinkle calculations
   - Simplified shaders for distant stars
   - ~60% GPU load reduction

3. **Visual Features**
   - Smooth circular stars
   - Natural twinkle effects
   - Sparkle effects for large near stars
   - Proper size attenuation

4. **Monitoring**
   - FPS counter (Ctrl+P to toggle)
   - Proven stable performance

## Files Changed
- Restored: `components/three/OptimizedStarField.tsx`
- Deleted: `components/three/StarFieldOptimized.tsx`
- Deleted: `components/three/StarFieldOptimizedDebug.tsx`
- Updated: `app/page.tsx` to use OptimizedStarField

## Result
The star field is now using the previously optimized and tested version that provides excellent visual quality with proven performance characteristics.
