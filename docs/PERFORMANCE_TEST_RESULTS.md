## Analysis

### Why Minimal Improvements?

1. **Simple Calculations**: Current star field math (sin/cos for twinkle effects) is too simple for WASM benefits
2. **V8 Optimization**: JavaScript JIT compiler already optimizes these operations very well
3. **WASM Overhead**: Data transfer between JS and WASM negates benefits for small operations
4. **Light Workload**: 15,000 stars with simple calculations isn't heavy enough

### Key Observations

1. **High CPU Usage (93%)**:
   - Both implementations are CPU-bound
   - Indicates room for algorithmic optimization
   - Good candidate for more complex WASM optimizations

2. **High Jank Rate (52%)**:
   - Over half of frames take >16.67ms
   - Indicates timing/scheduling issues
   - Both implementations affected equally

3. **Consistent Performance**:
   - Very low standard deviation (±0.08-0.12 FPS)
   - Both implementations stable at 60 FPS
   - No performance degradation over time

4. **Memory Overhead**:
   - WASM adds ~6.7 MB overhead
   - Acceptable for future complex calculations
   - No memory leaks detected

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Continue with heavier computations** where WASM excels:
   - Bezier path calculations (Task 6)
   - Particle system batch updates (Task 7)
   - Spatial indexing for collision detection (Task 8)

2. **Optimize algorithms** before porting to WASM:
   - Reduce jank by optimizing render loop
   - Consider LOD (Level of Detail) for distant stars
   - Batch GPU operations more efficiently

### Long Term
1. **SIMD optimizations** for batch operations
2. **Shared memory buffers** to reduce data transfer overhead
3. **WebGPU compute shaders** for massively parallel operations

## Conclusion

Current WASM implementation shows expected results for simple calculations. The real benefits will come when implementing more complex algorithms where JavaScript's performance limitations become apparent. The high CPU usage and jank rate indicate opportunities for both algorithmic and WASM optimizations.

Next steps should focus on implementing Bezier path calculations (Task 6) which involve more complex math operations where WASM can demonstrate significant performance improvements.
