# Star Field Ultra-Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of star field optimizations. Each phase has a status flag that will be updated as work progresses.

**Rules:**
- No tests/benchmarks/comparisons
- Wait for approval between phases  
- No summaries/completion files
- Preserve visual quality

---

## Phase 1: Zero-Copy Shared Memory Architecture
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED  
**Goal:** Eliminate memory copies between WASM and JS

### Tasks:
- [x] Create WASM memory pool structure with persistent star data
- [x] Implement `initialize_star_memory_pool` function returning pointers
- [x] Add `update_frame_simd` for in-place memory updates
- [x] Update TypeScript interface for shared memory
- [x] Modify StarField.tsx to use shared memory views
- [x] Fix memory allocation issues (removed manual malloc/free)

### Implementation Details:
- Persistent WASM memory pools with raw pointers
- JS TypedArray views into WASM linear memory (zero-copy!)
- Direct GPU upload from shared memory
- Camera matrix handling deferred to Phase 2

## Phase 2: Structure-of-Arrays Memory Layout
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Optimize for SIMD cache efficiency

### Tasks:
- [ ] Restructure star data from Array-of-Structures to Structure-of-Arrays
- [ ] Separate x/y/z coordinates into contiguous arrays  
- [ ] Align memory to 32-byte boundaries for AVX
- [ ] Update all SIMD functions to use new layout

---

## Phase 3: Core SIMD Optimizations  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Vectorize all per-frame calculations

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement SIMD star effects calculation (twinkle/sparkle)
- [ ] Add SIMD frustum culling with f32x8
- [ ] Vectorize temporal coherence checks
- [ ] Create SIMD rotation delta calculations

---

## Phase 4: Star Generation SIMD
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Optimize initial star creation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Vectorize position generation (8 stars at once)
- [ ] SIMD color generation with mask operations
- [ ] Batch size calculations  
- [ ] SIMD random number generation

---

## Phase 5: Bitpacked Visibility Culling
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Reduce memory usage 8x for visibility

### Tasks:
- [ ] Replace byte array with bit array (64 stars per u64)
- [ ] Implement SIMD bit manipulation for bulk operations
- [ ] Update JS to handle bitpacked visibility
- [ ] Optimize GPU instancing with visibility masks

---

## Phase 6: Advanced SIMD Operations
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Maximize SIMD throughput

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement f32x16 operations where supported
- [ ] Add memory prefetching hints
- [ ] Unroll critical loops
- [ ] Optimize sin/cos lookup tables for SIMD

---

## Phase 7: Hierarchical Spatial Acceleration
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Logarithmic culling complexity

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build octree for spatial queries
- [ ] SIMD AABB vs frustum tests
- [ ] Hierarchical LOD selection
- [ ] Early rejection of star clusters

---

## Phase 8: WebGPU Compute Integration (Optional)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ NOT_STARTED  
**Goal:** Offload to GPU compute

### Tasks:
- [ ] Generate WebGPU compute shaders from Rust
- [ ] Parallel star effects on GPU
- [ ] Hybrid CPU/GPU processing
- [ ] Fallback to WASM when WebGPU unavailable
