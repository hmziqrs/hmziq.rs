# Star Field Ultra-Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of star field optimizations. Each phase has a status flag that will be updated as work progresses.

**Rules:**
- No tests/benchmarks/comparisons
- Wait for approval between phases
- No summaries/completion files
- Preserve visual quality
