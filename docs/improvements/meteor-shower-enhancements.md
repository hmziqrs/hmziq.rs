# Meteor Shower Enhancements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Meteors Disappearing Before Screen Edge ✅
**Problem**: Meteors were ending at `canvas.height - 100`, making them disappear 100 pixels before the bottom edge.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `bottomY` from `canvas.height - 100` to `canvas.height + 20`
- Updated end positions for side spawns to extend beyond screen edges
- Now meteors travel completely off-screen before disappearing

### 2. Natural Debris Particles ✅
**Problem**: Particles were spawning at trail end in patches, looking unnatural.

**Solution**:
- Particles now spawn from meteor HEAD and are left behind as debris
- Inherit 30% of meteor velocity with small random deviation
- No gravity, just air resistance (0.98 damping) for ethereal effect
- Extended lifespan (30 frames) for more natural debris trails
- Subtle colored glow instead of bright white sparks
- Larger, softer gradients for debris-like appearance

### 3. Enhanced Shine Effect ✅
**Problem**: Meteor cores needed a dramatic "shine" effect like an inverted drop shadow. Initial implementation had scaling issues - too big on large meteors, invisible on small ones.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Balanced Shine Scaling**
   - Base shine size of 15px ensures visibility on small meteors
   - Proportional component (size * 10) scales with meteor size
   - Combined approach (base + proportional) creates balanced effect
   - Uses screen blend mode for additive light effect
   - Intensity based on meteor's glow intensity

2. **Enhanced Core Brightness**
   - Increased core size from 3x to 5x meteor size
   - Extended bright white area with more gradient stops
   - Added extra bright center shine layer
   - Bright meteors now 2.0-2.5 intensity (was 1.5-2.0)
   - Bright meteors 80% larger for dramatic effect

3. **Improved Spark Effects**
   - Higher spawn rate for bright meteors (40% vs 25%)
   - Smaller, more realistic spark sizes
   - Glowing white-hot centers
   - Random motion with gravity for natural movement

## Visual Improvements

- **Complete trajectories**: Meteors travel beyond screen boundaries
- **Realistic sparks**: Trail-end particles fly off in random directions like fire sparks
- **Dramatic shine**: Large radial glow creates star-like gleam effect
- **Enhanced brightness**: Multiple layered glows for depth and brilliance
