# Small Meteor Visibility Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Trail Rendering Artifacts for Small Meteors ✅
**Problem**: Small meteors (size 0.3-0.5) had graphic artifacts in their trails due to extremely thin trail widths.

**Solution**: 
- **Tapered trails**: Added 2px minimum base width (was calculated as low as 1.5px)
- **Smooth trails**: Added 1.5px minimum base width
- **Simple trails**: Added 1.2px minimum base width
- Increased minimum trail width from 0.1 to 0.5 for better visibility

### 2. Particle Travel Distance Too Short ✅
**Problem**: Particles disappeared too quickly, not traveling far enough from meteors.

**Solution**:
- **Doubled velocity deviation**: Increased from 0.8 to 1.6 for longer trajectories
- **Reduced air resistance**: Changed from 0.98 to 0.99 damping factor
- Result: Particles now travel approximately 2x further before fading

### 3. Particles Non-Visible for Small Meteors ✅
**Problem**: Small meteors (size 0.3) produced particles too small to see (0.06-0.15 size).

**Solution**:
- **Minimum particle size**: Set to 0.15 regardless of meteor size
- **Size calculation improved**: Now uses `max(0.15, meteor.size * (0.25-0.6))`
- **Higher spawn rate for small meteors**: 50% increase for meteors < 0.5 size
- Result: All meteors now produce visible particles

## Technical Details

### Trail Width Calculations
```javascript
// Before (could be as low as 0.3 for small meteors)
const maxWidth = Math.min(meteor.size * 5, 4)

// After (minimum 2px guaranteed)
const baseWidth = 2
const maxWidth = Math.max(baseWidth, Math.min(meteor.size * 5, 4))
```

### Particle Improvements
```javascript
// Minimum size guarantee
const baseParticleSize = 0.15
particle.size = Math.max(baseParticleSize, meteor.size * (0.25 + Math.random() * 0.35))

// Higher spawn rate for small meteors
const sizeMultiplier = meteor.size < 0.5 ? 1.5 : 1.0
```

## Visual Impact
- Small meteors now have smooth, artifact-free trails
- Particles are visible and travel further for all meteor sizes
- Overall effect is more consistent across all meteor sizes

### 4. Particles Moving in Front of Meteors ✅
**Problem**: Particles were spawning with random velocities in all directions, causing some to fly forward ahead of the meteor, which looked unnatural.

**Solution**:
- **Spawn position**: Particles now start 2x meteor size behind the meteor head
- **Directional velocity**: Particles move backwards in a 120° cone (±60° from opposite direction)
- **Speed control**: Base velocity is 50% of meteor speed in opposite direction
- **Natural spread**: Random speed variation between 0.5x-1.5x base speed

### Particle Direction Fix
```javascript
// Spawn behind meteor
const behindDistance = meteor.size * 2
particle.x = meteor.x - Math.cos(meteorAngleRad) * behindDistance

// Move backwards in cone
const backwardAngle = meteorAngleRad + Math.PI
const spreadAngle = (Math.random() - 0.5) * (Math.PI / 3)  // ±60°
const particleAngle = backwardAngle + spreadAngle
```

## Final Result
- Particles now create realistic debris trails that only move backwards
- No more particles flying ahead of meteors
- Natural-looking debris effect with proper physics
