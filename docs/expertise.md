# Expertise Section Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis
- Simple card-based layout with 3 columns (Frontend, Backend, Cross-Platform)
- Basic hover effects with subtle glow
- Skills displayed as simple rounded pills
- Minimal animation using Framer Motion

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. **3D Floating Skill Orbs** (Primary Enhancement)
Transform flat skill pills into 3D floating orbs using React Three Fiber
- Each orb will have:
  - Glowing particle effects matching the starfield aesthetic
  - Orbital motion around category centers
  - Interactive hover states with energy pulses
  - Color-coded by category (blue for Frontend, purple for Backend, cyan for Cross-Platform)

### 2. **Constellation Pattern Connections**
- Draw animated lines between related skills to form constellations
- Lines will pulse with energy when hovering over connected skills
- Creates visual relationships between technologies
- Example connections:
  - TypeScript connects to React.js, Next.js, React Native
  - Node.js connects to Express.js, AdonisJS
  - Rust connects to Dioxus, Tauri, Axum

### 3. **Skill Proficiency Visualization**
Add visual proficiency indicators using:
- Orb size variations (larger = more proficient)
- Glow intensity (brighter = more experience)
- Particle density around each orb
- Pulsation frequency (faster = actively used)

### 4. **Interactive Category Planets**
- Transform category headers into interactive "planets"
- Skills orbit around their respective category planet
- Click to zoom into a category for detailed view
- Planet properties:
  - Frontend: Blue nebula effect
  - Backend: Purple core with energy rings
  - Cross-Platform: Cyan aurora borealis effect

### 5. **Parallax Depth Effects**
- Multiple layers of skill orbs at different depths
- Mouse movement creates parallax effect
- Integrates with existing starfield for cohesive experience
- Depth layers:
  - Background: Faint skill echoes
  - Midground: Secondary skills
  - Foreground: Primary expertise

### 6. **Advanced Animations**
- Skills materialize from stardust when scrolling into view
- Quantum fade effect for skill transitions
- Energy waves that ripple through the skill field
- Hover effects:
  - Orb expansion with particle burst
  - Constellation highlight
  - Info tooltip with experience details

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**
- Use WebAssembly for particle calculations (leveraging existing WASM setup)
- LOD (Level of Detail) system for orbs
- Frustum culling for off-screen elements
- Instanced rendering for multiple orbs
- Quality settings (low/medium/high) based on device capabilities

- Particle emit rate: 10 particles/second

### WebAssembly Implementation

#### Per-Frame Calculations
Following the established patterns from `docs/wasm.md` and existing StarField implementation:

##### 1. **Skill System Memory Structure** (SoA Pattern)
```rust
// Structure of Arrays for SIMD optimization
pub struct SkillSystemMemory {
    // Orbital positions
    positions_x: Vec<f32>,
    positions_y: Vec<f32>,
    positions_z: Vec<f32>,
    
    // Orbital parameters
    orbit_radius: Vec<f32>,
    orbit_speed: Vec<f32>,
    orbit_phase: Vec<f32>,
    category_center_x: Vec<f32>,
    category_center_z: Vec<f32>,
    
    // Visual properties
    glow_intensity: Vec<f32>,
    scale: Vec<f32>,
    hover_states: u64, // Bitpacked booleans
    
    // Particle system data
    particle_positions_x: Vec<f32>,
    particle_positions_y: Vec<f32>,
    particle_positions_z: Vec<f32>,
    particle_velocities: Vec<f32>,
    
    count: usize,
}
```

##### 2. **SIMD Batch Processing**
Using `f32x16` for processing 16 skills simultaneously:
- Orbital position updates
- Glow intensity interpolation
- Particle system updates
- Mouse parallax calculations

##### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Lookup Tables**: Pre-computed sin/cos for orbital motion
- **Zero-Copy Memory**: Direct memory sharing with JavaScript
- **Bitpacking**: Boolean states packed into u64 values
- **SIMD-First**: No fallback implementations, only remainder handling

##### 4. **Expected Performance Metrics**
Based on current StarField benchmarks:
- ~12 skills (vs 5000+ stars currently handled)
- Orbital calculations: ~0.1ms per frame
- Particle effects: ~1-2ms per frame
- Constellation updates: ~0.2ms per frame
- Total WASM overhead: ~2.3ms per frame (well within 16ms budget)

### Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain semantic HTML structure underneath 3D layer
- Keyboard navigation support for skill selection
- Screen reader announcements for skill details
- Reduced motion fallback to current card layout
- High contrast mode support

### SEO Preservation
- Keep existing HTML structure as base layer
- 3D elements as progressive enhancement
- Skill text remains crawlable
- Meta descriptions for each skill
