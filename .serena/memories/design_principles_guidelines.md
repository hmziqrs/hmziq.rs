# Design Principles & Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
1. **Subtlety First**: Animations and effects should enhance, not overwhelm
2. **Smooth Experience**: Focus on fluid animations (60fps target)
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure content is accessible without JavaScript
4. **Uniqueness**: Stand out through creative implementation, not gimmicks
5. **Professionalism**: Maintain professional tone despite creative elements

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Neutral monochrome palette (black, white, grays)
- **Background**: Deep black (#000000) for space theme
- **Text**: High contrast white (#FFFFFF) on dark backgrounds  
- **Accents**: Subtle gray variations (#111111, #222222, #888888)
- **Effects**: Slight blue/purple tints for star glow effects only

## Animation Guidelines
- Keep animations subtle and smooth (60fps target)
- Implement parallax scrolling using Intersection Observer API
- Use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations
- Consider using Framer Motion for declarative animations
- **ALWAYS respect prefers-reduced-motion** preferences

## Three.js Implementation Guidelines
- Use React Three Fiber for better React integration
- Implement star field as separate component with performance optimization
- Use @react-three/drei for common utilities
- Ensure proper cleanup of Three.js resources (prevent memory leaks)
- Consider using Suspense boundaries for 3D content loading
- Implement lazy loading for Three.js components
- Use `dynamic` imports from Next.js for client-side only components

## Accessibility Requirements
- Implement reduced motion preferences
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide proper focus indicators
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
- Include proper ARIA labels where needed

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy load Three.js components
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement Level of Detail (LOD) for complex 3D scenes
- Use efficient algorithms for particle systems
- Monitor and optimize frame rates continuously
